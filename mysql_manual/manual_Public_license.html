<p><strong>MySQL FREE PUBLIC LICENSE</strong> (Version 4, March 5, 1995) </p>

<p>Copyright (C) 1995, 1996 TcX AB &amp; Monty Program KB &amp; Detron HB Stockholm 
SWEDEN, Helsingfors FINLAND and Uppsala SWEDEN All rights reserved. </p>

<p>NOTE: This license is not the same as any of the GNU Licenses published by the Free 
Software Foundation. Its terms are substantially different from those of the GNU Licenses. 
If you are familiar with the GNU Licenses, please read this license with extra care. </p>

<p>This License applies to the computer program known as &quot;MySQL&quot;. The 
&quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to such program, and a &quot;work based on the 
Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative work of the Program, as defined 
in the United States Copyright Act of 1976, such as a translation or a modification. The 
Program is a copyrighted work whose copyright is held by TcX Datakonsult AB and Monty 
Program KB and Detron HB. </p>

<p>This License does not apply when running &quot;MySQL&quot; on any Microsoft operating 
system. Microsoft operating systems include all versions of Microsoft Windows NT and 
Microsoft Windows. </p>

<p>BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM), YOU 
INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR 
COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN 
THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE 
WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM. 

<ol>
  <li>Licenses. Licensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you comply with 
    all of the restrictions set forth in this License and provided, further, that you 
    distribute an unmodified copy of this License with the Program: <ol>
      <li>You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the Program's source code 
        as you receive it throughout the world, in any medium. </li>
      <li>You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and distribute copies of 
        such throughout the world, in any medium. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Restrictions. This license is subject to the following restrictions: <ol>
      <li>Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a commercial 
        organization to any third party is prohibited if any payment is made in connection with 
        such distribution, whether directly (as in payment for a copy of the Program) or 
        indirectly (as in payment for some service related to the Program, or payment for some 
        product or service that includes a copy of the Program &quot;without charge&quot;; these 
        are only examples, and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited activities). However, 
        the following methods of distribution involving payment shall not in and of themselves be 
        a violation of this restriction: <ol>
          <li>Posting the Program on a public access information storage and retrieval service for 
            which a fee is received for retrieving information (such as an on-line service), provided 
            that the fee is not content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for retrieving the 
            same volume of information consisting of random data). </li>
          <li>Distributing the Program on a CD-ROM, provided that the files containing the Program are 
            reproduced entirely and verbatim on such CD-ROM, and provided further that all information 
            on such CD-ROM be redistributable for non-commercial purposes without charge. </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of the Program are not 
        subject to this License and they are outside its scope. Functional use (running) of the 
        Program is not restricted, and any output produced through the use of the Program is 
        subject to this license only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program 
        (independent of having been made by running the Program). </li>
      <li>You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to the distribution of any 
        work based on the Program: <ol>
          <li>If you have modified the Program, you must cause your work to carry prominent notices 
            stating that you have modified the Program's files and the date of any change; </li>
          <li>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part 
            contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole and 
            at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License; </li>
          <li>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause 
            it, at each time the modified program commences operation, to print or display an 
            announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no 
            warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty). Such notice must also state that 
            users may redistribute the Program only under the conditions of this License and tell the 
            user how to view the copy of this License included with the Program. (Exception: if the 
            Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work 
            based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.); </li>
          <li>You must accompany any such work based on the Program with the complete corresponding 
            machine-readable source code, delivered on a medium customarily used for software 
            interchange. The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
            modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source 
            code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the 
            scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable code. However, the 
            source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either 
            source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
            operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies 
            the executable code; </li>
          <li>If you distribute any written or printed material at all with the Program or any work 
            based on the Program, such material must include either a written copy of this License, or 
            a prominent written indication that the Program or the work based on the Program is 
            covered by this License and written instructions for printing and/or displaying the copy 
            of the License on the distribution medium; </li>
          <li>You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's exercise of the rights 
            granted herein. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the 
            equivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent ability to 
            copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even 
            though third parties are not compelled to copy the source code along with the object code. 
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Reservation of Rights. No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set 
    forth herein. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
    expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense 
    or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this 
    License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License 
    will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
  </li>
  <li>Other Restrictions. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
    certain countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical distribution 
    limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among 
    countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if 
    written in the body of this License. </li>
  <li>Limitations. THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU &quot;AS IS,&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE 
    IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED 
    TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND 
    NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE 
    OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL 
    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW 
    OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY 
    TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED 
    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO 
    OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF 
    THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </li>
